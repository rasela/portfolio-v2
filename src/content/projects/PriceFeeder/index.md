##### Underlying and Derivatives Price Feeder for Borsa Italiana

Oslo Bors (OB) derivatives market was migrated onto SOLA trading platform and the OSLO OM Secur clearing system was connected to the trading system through the Clearing-Gateway component. In order to make OM Secur able to get the latest underlying and derivatives prices needed to perform clearing operation, a new service named OBPriceFeeder was implemented that feeds OM Secur system with latest price updates.
